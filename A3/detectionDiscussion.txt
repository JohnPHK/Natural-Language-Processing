As anyone can see the model test accuracy is the highest at the hidden size 50.
There is a slight increase in the accuracy from hidden size from 5 to 10, and
biggest jump when the hidden size is 50. The accuracy went from ~0.3 to ~0.5 when
the hidden size was increased from 10 to 50.

changing --epochs did nothing to the accuracy. The optimizer 'sgd' had better accuracy 
than the adam accuracy. Decreasing the batch size increased number of iterations. 
However, it slightly (by very small amount) decreased the accuracy.
